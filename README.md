# PixelPort-Media-Player-for-Sony-Playstation-1
An audio CD player for the PS1 with more features than the factory player - Psyq SDK
Hold start to show the controls

Made with the assistance of orionsofts PS1USB device (https://www.orionsoft.games/retroshop/ps1usb.htm), the 'Hello CDDA' example by ABelliqueux (https://github.com/ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds/blob/main/hello_cdda/hello_cdda.c) and the TIM EXAMPLE on PsxDev (https://www.psxdev.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=313).
All printf's are redirected through the PS1USB to the console on the PC used to launch the app. This is just for debugging, though. Just an introduction for me to PsyQ SDK / some basic PS1 stuff in general and mainly wanting to know how to control the disc drive with some of the built in SDK stuff. At the bottom of the player is a progress bar calculated for each track.
